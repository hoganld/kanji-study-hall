# Kanji Study Hall

Kanji Study Hall is a simple web application which implements the [SuperMemo2](http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) spaced repetition algorithm.

KSH is specifically geared towards students of Japanese who are fans of James Heisig's [Remembering the Kanji](http://www.amazon.com/Remembering-Kanji-Complete-Japanese-Characters/dp/0824835921). KSH intends to provide an efficient tool for reviewing the keywords/characters/mnemonics (in both directions) as the student progresses through the course.

## Why another SRS program?

There are plenty of SRS programs out there already. Why am I writing another one? A few reasons:

* There are many things I love about the SRS tool I've been using the past few years, but having no distinction between "I shoulda had that one!" and "Did I ever even know that?" bugs me.
* I don't want a desktop app.
* I have some ideas for future extensions that are very specific to studying Japanese, rather than general-purpose memorization.
* It's fun!

### Development status
This is pre-alpha quality -- a brand new project. The templates don't even do anything yet.
